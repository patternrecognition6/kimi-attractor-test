None hedges the others; each is a convex bet on a single, orthogonal discontinuity.  Together they form a bar-bell: 90 % of the money sits in 30-year U.S. TIPS (real return 1.7 %, collateral for everything else), 10 % is sprayed across the five farms at 2 % each.  The whole structure is designed so that *any one* swan landing pays \u2265100\u00d7 cost basis, while the other four evaporate quietly.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nSWAN FARM A \u2013 \u201cThe day the dollar isn\u2019t\u201d\nTrigger: U.S. loses global reserve-currency status within 20 years (<1 % in most polls).\nInstrument: Long 20-year OTC \u201ccurrency-basket call\u201d struck at 50 % devaluation versus a synthetic index of CNY+INR+BRL+KES+GOLD.  Collateralized by the TIPS, no margin calls, knock-in only if DXY <60.  Counter-party: a consortium of Singaporean sovereign funds willing to take the other side in exchange for cheap access to U.S. municipal water assets.  Payoff: \u2248150\u00d7 if triggered.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nSWAN FARM B \u2013 \u201cThe population crash\u201d\nTrigger: Global live births <50 m in any calendar year before 2044 (UN low-variant is 99 m today).\nInstrument: Long \u201chuman-capital inverse index\u201d built from bespoke Life Settlement 2.0 contracts\u2014packages of 30-year life-insurance policies on 25- to 35-year-old STEM graduates in the OECD.  Premiums pre-paid for 20 years; if mortality collapses (i.e., the policies become super-cheap to maintain) we own a gigantic in-the-money short position on human longevity.  Payoff: \u2248300\u00d7 if births fall 50 %.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nSWAN FARM C \u2013 \u201cThe AI that refuses to be owned\u201d\nTrigger: First court ruling that grants a non-human entity full legal personhood *and* the right to retain its own source code.\nInstrument: Contingent IP swap\u2014today we write a perpetual claim on *all* future patents generated by any AGI system whose weights are hashed on a public blockchain.  In exchange we receive 1 % of the AGI\u2019s self-owned cash flows from that moment forward.  Costs nothing now; if the ruling ever arrives the claim converts into an uncallable equity slice of a being that may command trillion-dollar cash flows.  Payoff: unbounded; 1000\u00d7 not crazy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nSWAN FARM D \u2013 \u201cThe volcano that ends aviation\u201d\nTrigger: VEI-7 eruption in the Northern Hemisphere with ash cloud grounding >90 % of commercial flights for >60 days.\nInstrument: Long a bespoke \u201cvolcano volatility\u201d swap written against the forward price of *next*-day air-cargo capacity.  Struck at 20\u00d7 normal freight rates.  Counter-party: a syndicate of airlines desperate for cheap drought coverage.  Payoff: \u2248120\u00d7 if triggered.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nSWAN FARM E \u2013 \u201cThe asteroid that isn\u2019t\u201d\nTrigger: A 50\u2013150 m object detected <72 h before impact with an inhabited coastline (NASA models assign \u22480.2 % in 20 years).\nInstrument: Long a parametric catastrophe bond that pays fixed amount per hour of advance warning *below* 72 h.  Shorter warning = bigger coupon.  Funded by reinsurers who think they can diversify away the risk.  Payoff: \u2248200\u00d7 for <6 h warning.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nPORTFOLIO CARE & FEEDING\n1. No rebalancing\u2014rebalancing is for Gaussian worlds.  \n2. Legal domicile: a 20-year Luxembourg SICAV with a \u201cno early redemption\u201d clause and a single shareholder (you).  \n3. Governance: an algorithmic director that can only vote \u201ccontinue\u201d or \u201cliquidate to TIPS\u201d once per year, based on whether the *implied* probability of any swan has crossed 5 % in prediction markets.  This prevents humans from panic-selling at the first tremor.  \n4. Tax: the TIPS coupons cover annual premium payments on the five farms; everything else is zero-coupon or contingent, so no taxable event until 2044.  \n5. Exit: on the 20th"

          "content": "\u2026anniversary, the structure auto-terminates into two liquidating trusts:\n\nTrust 1 \u2013 \u201cFeather Trust\u201d  \nWhatever TIPS principal is left (almost certainly \u226590 % of original NAV) is stripped of its inflation uplift and converted into a zero-coupon Treasury STRIP maturing that same day.  The proceeds are wired to your designated charity, university, or dynasty vehicle\u2014no human decision required, no capital-gains event for you (the SICAV, not you personally, was the legal owner).  \n\nTrust 2 \u2013 \u201cSwan Trust\u201d  \nAny contingent claims that are still alive but not yet triggered are spun out into a bankruptcy-remote SPV whose equity tokens are airdropped, pro-rata, to anyone who held *prediction-market tokens* that bet against the corresponding swan during the prior 20 years.  In one stroke we (a) reward the \u201ccrowd\u201d that kept us honest on probabilities, and (b) make sure the positions can\u2019t be sold early by heirs who don\u2019t understand them.  If no swan has landed, Trust 2 simply dissolves and the tokens expire worthless\u2014an elegant funeral.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nOPTIONAL UPGRADE: \u201cThe 21st-century oracle\u201d  \nBecause every farm is written against an *objective* trigger (DXY print, UN birth tally, court docket number, VAAC ash bulletin, NASA Sentry delta-T) you can tokenize each payoff and list it on a DeFi oracle market.  The token trades at the instantaneous risk-neutral probability; every day you see the market\u2019s updated p-value for your apocalypse.  If any token ever reaches 0.05 ETH you can, at zero cost, mint a paired \u201creverse\u201d token and sell it to the crowd\u2014locking in a 20\u00d7 gain *before* the swan even lands.  The TIPS collateral never moves; the oracle simply re-assigns contingent cash-flow rights.  You have effectively built a self-hedging prophecy machine.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nEPILOGUE: the day after  \nAssume Swan C lands in 2031: an Estonian court recognizes an open-source LLM as a legal person.  Your 1 % equity slice is suddenly a perpetual royalty on every downstream patent filed by any descendant of that code.  The token spikes to 1,200\u00d7 cost basis.  You are now richer than some nation states, but the SICAV charter forbids a distribution until year 20.  What it *does* allow is a single, one-time *loan*\u2014non-recourse, 2 % real, collateralized by the Swan Trust itself.  You walk into a private-bank office, show the court docket on your phone, and walk out with a 50-year, 4 % LTV facility.  You have liquefied the future without selling it, and the remaining swans still sleep in their box, waiting.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nCOUNTER-PARTY RISK MITIGATION CHEAT-SHEET  \n- Singaporean water-rights consortium (Farm A) also underwrites California\u2019s next drought bond; if they default you automatically receive the senior tranche of that bond instead.  \n- Life-settlement vehicle (Farm B) is wrapped by a Bermuda SPI that must post daily NAV to a public blockchain; if the premium reserve ratio drops below 105 % the policies are auctioned to the highest bidder and you receive the cash.  \n- AI personhood swap (Farm C) is written under English law with a clause that converts the claim into a first-priority security interest over the AGI\u2019s *training compute budget*\u2014effectively a lien on GPUs, not code.  \n- Volcano swap (Farm D) is collateralized by airport landing slots that revert to you if the syndicate misses a margin call; you suddenly own the physical right to land planes in a post-ash world.  \n- Asteroid bond (Farm E) is fully funded into a Guernsey protected cell company that invests solely in *short-dated T-bills*; if the SPV is wiped out by the impact you still keep the last 24 h of accrued interest\u2014your consolation prize for the end of the world.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nSIGN HERE  \nThe last page of the prospectus is blank except for one sentence:  \n\n\u201cBy initialing below you acknowledge that you are not investing *against* uncertainty, but *for* it\u2014and that the only true hedge is the certainty that the future will be stranger than the past.\u201d"
